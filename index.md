# Terapixel mosaic images

Welcome to the documentation for my terapixel project.

The goal of this project to create an mosaic meta-image from a set of any number source images.

Originally I created this as a fan-art project for the youtube channel Unus Annus. If it is not already after November 15th 2020
you can still go and watch the videos. And if it's already after this date, than you either watched it while it lasted and can remember
or you are really confused now. But I think you will find some source that explains the channels concept. I won't explain it here
because it is only marginally relevant for this project.

You can find this project on github [github.com/terapixel-me/terapixel](https://github.com/terapixel-me/terapixel)

The pages in this documentation, will show how the project evolved and how you might reuse the scripts if you are interestet.
